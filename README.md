# PPOL564 | Coding Discussions

The following repository houses all coding discussion for PPOL564 for the Fall 2020 term. New discussions will be posted in new folders with a instruction in each regarding the student task. All student work will be public. 

Most weeks there will be a coding problem/prompt/dataset to explore pushed to the class Github repository. Students enrolled in PPOL564 will be required to submit an original response to the week's prompt. 

Submission will be assigned `2` points each week a coding discussion is assigned. A point will be awarded for (1) submitting on time and (2) the quality of the post & response. "Quality" is defined as an _original_, well-commented, and clear solution/analysis (i.e. the solution follows the guidelines required for each coding assignment entry - see "Problem Sets" on the class syllabus). Students are encouraged to generate a response before looking at the responses of their peers. If a student appears to have copied an answer of another student, we'll examine the time stamp and only award a quality point to the first entry of the timeline of responses that appear duplicative. 

**All submission must be posted by Sunday by 11:59PM.**. The schedule for the coding assignments are listed below.

The goal of the coding discussions is to apply a concept learned during the week in a way that helps build a greater level of programming fluency. Programming skills are honed through active usage and repetition. Learning to read other people’s code and detecting issues is vital to successful collaborations in applied work. The point is not to be “right” necessarily but rather to try, learn, and collaborate. As such, when receiving suggested edit requests

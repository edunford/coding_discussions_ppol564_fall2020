a. I decided to come to a public policy school because I love civic tech (s/o to Chi Hack Night) so I find the the intersection of data science and public policy super exciting! I'm specifically interested in technology policy and environmental policy. I studied Electrical Engineering in undergrad (specializing in power and renewable energy) and for my capstone I designed a circuit that would store the excess energy from an oil rig's motor torque into a battery. More recently in my work, I put together a business case for using solar energy to power AT&Tâ€™s data centers nationally and then joined a cyber security team that fiddled with AT&T network data. TLDR, 1) I love civic tech and data 2) I'm all about intersectional enviromentalism 3) Excited to be here!
b. This week I finally grasped git. I've tried teaching myself before and honestly struggled with understanding it. Using the visualizations and graphics to explain the staging/workflow was a GAMECHANGER.

a. I chose to study at a public policy school because I love fighting for social justice. I'm especially interested in any policy relating to gender and sex (but also okay with relating to race) because growing up, I faced sexual discrimination from my parents.
b. I learned how to create a git repository and push using the commandline.

a. I decided to come to a public policy school because I'm interested in international development policy. I think DC is probably the best place to see how policies function, so I joined McCourt.
B. I learned how to customize my commandline using "Oh My Zsh". My terminal shell now looks super pretty.
